# Course logistics and overview

This is the fall 2019 offering of CS 787, taught by Christos Tzamos.

An undergraduate course in algorithms typically covers simpler algorithms that
were often developed in the 90s or earlier. In this class, we will be exploring
recently published algorithms and areas under current research. We will focus
on novel techniques and general strategies with which to approach problems.

## Topics
- Hashing  
  Our discussion of hashing will include a review of probability, which we'll
  see again in randomized algorithms.
- Flows  
  Undergraduate courses cover some network flow algorithms, and we'll see more
  complex cases such as the min-cost flow problem.
- Linear programming (LP)  
  Flows are a specific case of the constraint problems seen in linear
  programming; we'll explore more general problems.
- Approximation algorithms  
  These algorithms provide tractable, "good enough" solutions for NP-hard
  problems 
- Online algorithms  
  We don't always have access to all of our input at once - online algorithms
  show us how to make decisions for input that may arrive sequentially, and how
  to handle the uncertainty around future input.
- Randomized algorithms  
  Randomized algorithms can be faster than deterministic approaches.
- Convex/submodular optimization  
  Traditional algorithms usually rely on discrete math, but we'll explore some
  methods that don't make this assumption.

## Grading 
- Problem sets (90 points). Christos will assign 6 problem sets over the course
  of the semester. Each problem set will be handed out on a Tuesday and be due
  two weeks afterwards. Collaboration on the problems sets is encouraged, but
  groups must be no more than 3 students and each student must hand in an
  individual submission and list the names of their collaborators.
- Scribing (10 points). Each student must provide scribe notes for one lecture
  during the semester, and supervise/proofread the scribe notes of another
  lecture. Scribe notes will be sent to Christos for review by the next lecture
  and will be posted publicly on Canvas.
- Grading (10 points). Each student must grade one homework problem. Problem
  sets will contain four problems, and each problem will be graded by the same
  student, so disparities in grader strictness should be applied equally and
  balance out over the semester. Christos will provide a solution key for the
  problems, but graders are expected to provide helpful feedback when scoring a
  problem. Ideally, graders will benefit from seeing the variety of approaches to
  the same problem.

Note that there are 110 total points. The 10 extra points count as a "bonus"
and provide some flexibility in grading. As a consequence, no late homeworks
will be accepted.

## Miscellaneous logistics
- Canvas will be used for file managment and Piazza for announcements, Q+A, and
  general discussion.  
- There is no textbook. Course material will consist of scribe notes along with
  papers and readings provided by Christos.
- Christos' office hours are Wednesdays from 1-2 PM in his office at CS 4375.
