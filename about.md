I am a second year PhD student in [Biomedical Data Science](https://biostat.wisc.edu/PHD-Biomedical-Data-Science) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 
My rotation projects so far have been with [Dr. Sushmita Roy](https://roylab.discovery.wisc.edu/) on strategies to infer transcriptional regulatory networks on single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets,
and with [Dr. Colin Dewey](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~cdewey/) on methods to resolve isoform structures from long-read sequencing. 
I also help instruct some of the Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry for Genomics workshops offered through UW-Madison's [Data Science Hub](https://datascience.wisc.edu/).
My funding is generously provided by a pre-doctoral traineeship through the [Computation and Informatics in Biology and Medicine](https://cibm.wisc.edu) program.

From 2015 through 2018 I worked as a bioinformatics specialist under [Dr.
Michael Talkowski](https://talkowski.mgh.harvard.edu/) at Massachusetts General
Hospital's Center for Genomic Medicine. I developed a pipeline to detect
genomic structural variants from whole-genome sequencing and applied it to a
2,000 sample autism cohort. I received my undergraduate degree in computer
science from Dartmouth College in 2015.

In my free time I enjoy running, bouldering, and skiing, and exploring nearby
and faraway places with my wife, Amanda.
