I am a Principal Bioinformatics Scientist at [Fulcrum Genomics](https://fulcrumgenomics.com/), where I build bioinformatics tools and pipelines to support biotech clients large and small. 

## Where I've been

I was most recently the bioinformatics lead at [Modulus Therapeutics](https://www.modulustherapeutics.com/) in Seattle, where I developed pipelines and analyses to support [a discovery program for CAR NK immunotherapies](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.02.551530.full.pdf).

I was previously the lead data scientist for the [Fred Hutch Innovation Lab](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/research/institutes-networks-ircs/fred-hutch-innovation-lab.html), where I co-developed a [BioConductor package for the clustering of spatial transcriptomic data](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8763026/) and collaborated with industry partners to incubate novel single-cell RNA, spatial RNA, and TCR sequencing technologies.

I have also worked as a bioinformatics specialist under [Dr.  Michael
Talkowski](https://talkowski.mgh.harvard.edu/) at Massachusetts General
Hospital's Center for Genomic Medicine, where I developed a pipeline to detect
genomic structural variants from whole-genome sequencing and [applied it to a
2,076 sample autism cohort](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5961723/). 

I completed my master's degree in biomedical data science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I completed rotation projects with [Dr. Sushmita Roy](https://roylab.discovery.wisc.edu/) and [Dr. Colin Dewey](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~cdewey/), and was funded by the [Computation and Informatics in Biology and Medicine](https://cibm.wisc.edu/) program.

I received my undergraduate degree in computer science from Dartmouth College.
